# Co2-Emission-Predictor

Overview:
  This GitHub repository contains a simple yet effective implementation of a Multiple Linear Regression model built from scratch in Python. The model is designed to predict the CO2 emissions of vehicles based on a 
  set of input features. Linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistics, and this project serves as a practical example of its application.

Dataset:
  The model uses a real-world dataset that includes various attributes of vehicles, such as engine size, number of cylinders, fuel consumption, fuel type, and transmission type. The target variable is CO2 
  emissions, which is a crucial factor in evaluating a vehicle's environmental impact.

Key Features:
  Implementation of a Multiple Linear Regression model without external machine learning libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib only).
  Dataset preprocessing, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
  Evaluation metrics: R-squared (R²).
  Visualization of actual vs. predicted CO2 emissions.

Results:
  The model's performance can be assessed based on R² metrics. A high R² value (about 0.94) indicates a good fit to the data.

Acknowledgments:
  This project was created as part of a machine learning and data analysis learning journey.
